# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A demo at [openmantel.com/demo](https://openmantel.com/demo/): 25 sample photos playing in the browser the way a frame shows them, with the blurred backdrop, captions, arrow keys, and tap for details. It's a static page that needs no server, linked from the product page.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-03

The first tagged release. Docker images are published as `0.1.0`, `0.1`, and `latest`.

### Added

- Optional two-factor login, off by default. Turn it on from Security, under More, with your password, a QR code for Google Authenticator or any authenticator app, and one code to confirm. Ten one-time recovery codes are shown once. Logging in then asks for the 6-digit code after the password, and five wrong codes lock out for five minutes, with no more than ten wrong codes an hour checked in all. Turning it off needs the password and a code. `pnpm security:reset-2fa` turns it off from the server if the phone and codes are both lost.
- Activity log: logins, wrong passwords and lockouts, sessions, pairing, frames, uploads, and deletes, with time, IP, and browser, kept 90 days. An Activity button in the admin bar on every page opens it, with a count of the last day's warnings.
- Break glass: Sign out everything, on the Sessions page, ends every login and deactivates every frame at once, after a typed confirmation and the password.
- Forget all browsers, on the Sessions page, for a lost device. Changing the password forgets them too.
- Frame cards show whether each frame is playing or paused, highlight the matching remote button as soon as it's pressed, and say how long the frame has been online.
- A show/hide button on the login password.
- Tap or click a frame to see the photo's caption, date, camera settings, size, and tags, holding it on screen until the next tap, a new photo, or two minutes. Frames never get the location. The admin's own slideshow does the same, with an Exit slideshow button for phones.
- Each frame card has a Timing section, with ten choices from 10 seconds to an hour. New frames show each photo for a minute.
- The frame pairing screen names the project and its GitHub address, as plain text so a kiosk can't be stranded on another site.
- Demo mode. A new install fetches 15 random royalty-free photos from Lorem Picsum on first start, tagged, about half captioned, in two playlists with a preset, so it can be tried at once. A banner shows the mode and the load progress. New demo photos swaps in a fresh set after one confirmation, keeping frames paired. The first upload of your own switches the app to live for good; leftover demo photos can then be removed with the typed count and password. Start over can load the demo afterwards. `NUXT_DEMO_AUTOLOAD=false` starts empty instead.
- Start over, under More: deletes every photo, frame, playlist, tag, and preset after two confirmations, a 10-second wait, a sentence typed by hand with pasting blocked, and the admin password. The server checks the same things, with a one-time token that must be at least 10 seconds old.
- Deleting two or more photos needs the count typed by hand (for example `delete 12 photos`), the admin password, and a 5-second wait. One photo keeps its single confirmation, and single deletes are limited to 30 a minute so they can't be used to get around this.
- README screenshots of Photos, photo details, Frames, a playlist, pairing, a frame on the wall, and the phone view, plus a See it section on openmantel.com.
- README section on why OpenMantel is self-hosted rather than offered as a free hosted service.
- Help on the Pair a frame page explaining where the code comes from, with this site's address.
- Photo details: a ⋮ button on each photo in the grid opens its file name, dates, size, tags, playlists, the original's format, file size, compression, colour space and profile, camera and lens settings, location if recorded, and the four frame images with their sizes.
- Security audits section in the README: the first red/blue team audit, with every finding and its mitigation, kept newest first with earlier audits compressed.
- A Playlist dropdown beside Show, so Start slideshow plays all photos (the default) or a chosen playlist, with Order and Play on as before.
- Playlists: named, hand-picked sets of photos in their own order. Drag photos in from the library, drag to reorder, and drag one back out, with tap buttons on phones. Add selected photos from the grid, or start a new playlist from them. A frame shows either its tags or a playlist, in playlist order or shuffled, and playlists appear in the Show dropdown.
- Start slideshow plays on all frames, one frame, or this screen, and leaves other frames as they are. A remote beside it works the chosen frames.
- A large Deactivate button on each frame, with an "are you sure" dialog. A deactivated frame goes back to its pairing screen.
- Technical details page in the admin, showing the version, commit, build time, Node, SQLite and schema migrations, library versions, and storage paths, with a summary to copy into bug reports. The Docker image records its commit for it.
- GitHub link in the admin navigation.
- Order for the admin slideshow, next to the tag dropdown: Random, the default, or Sequential, in your arranged order.
- Rearrange view: a compact grid where you hold and drag, or tap a photo and tap where it goes. It replaces the drag handle on phones.
- Captions on or off for each frame.
- Schedules: a frame can switch to a preset on chosen days and times, using its own clock.
- Show on a frame: send any photo to an online frame from the grid.
- Monitor off overnight on Macs, with `SLEEP_START` and `SLEEP_END`.
- Option to skip photos that don't suit a frame's screen shape.
- On this day, in the tag dropdown and as a frame option.

- Frame setup scripts for Mac, Ubuntu, Windows, and Raspberry Pi.
- `pnpm photos:rebuild` to recreate frame images from originals.
- API tests, type checking, and a GitHub Actions workflow that runs both.
- The Frames page says how many frames are online, and lists online frames first.
- 25 more sample photos, tagged by what they show, with 14 new tags.
- Stats tab with library totals, live CPU, memory, swap, and disk use, and roughly how many more photos will fit.
- Left and right arrow keys to change photos in the slideshow.
- Nightly checked SQLite snapshots kept for 14 days, with an optional off-site copy through rclone.
- Service worker library cache and prefetching, so each frame downloads each photo once and keeps playing offline, even after a restart.
- Small offline dot on frames, and a page reload every 6 hours.
- Silent device token rotation every 30 days, with a 24-hour grace window.
- Dark admin redesign with large type, library numbers, and a bar chart of photos by tag.
- Start slideshow button that plays full screen in any logged-in browser, with no pairing.
- Tag dropdown shared by the slideshow and grid. No tag plays every photo in random order.

### Changed

- Tags moved into the More menu, with the new Security page, to keep the admin bar short.
- The Activity log caps warnings and other events separately and records a repeated warning from one address once a minute, so a flood of wrong passwords can't push real events out.

- README describes live frame state, new photos playing next, and the login protection.
- The Frames page thumbnail follows the frame's photo within seconds: frames report every photo change, pause, and resume, and the page refreshes every 5 seconds while it's open.
- New photos play next on frames that include them, instead of waiting for their turn, and a deleted or hidden photo leaves the screen at once. Regenerating the demo now shows on frames within a couple of seconds.
- The login lockout counts an attempt before checking the password, so guesses sent all at once can't slip past it, and a flood of wrong guesses from many addresses limits unknown browsers (one try per address shared with its /24 or /48, at most 30 attempts a minute) while browsers that have logged in before skip those limits, so the owner is never locked out.
- Five wrong passwords lock that address out of logging in for five minutes. Each wrong try says how many are left, and the login button counts the lockout down. Other addresses can still log in, so nobody can lock the owner out. Start over, bulk delete, and demo removal share the same check and lockout.
- Frame captions are smaller, about 28 px on a 1080p screen, in a Helvetica-like sans-serif from the system.
- An unpaired screen goes straight to pairing without any refused requests, so the browser console stays clean, and the login form has a hidden username field for password managers.
- Fixes from a review of Start over and demo mode:
  - Start over and removing the demo now wait their turn in the photo queue and stop a demo load in progress, so photos can't reappear after everything was deleted.
  - The app only returns to demo mode while none of the owner's photos are there.
  - Removing the demo keeps demo playlists and presets the owner has edited, filled, or put on a frame, and takes deleted tags out of every filter.
  - Remove the demo photos works on any size of library.
  - Load demo photos asks first.
  - The demo download only follows redirects within picsum.photos, checks the type, and caps its size while reading.
  - An install with frames, playlists, tags, or presets but no photos isn't given the demo.
  - The grid refreshes only when a demo photo arrives.
- The admin declares its language, for screen readers.
- openmantel.com: responsive WebP images (about 340 KB less on a phone), a favicon, a canonical URL, author and dates, Schema.org JSON-LD, `llms.txt`, `robots.txt`, and a sitemap.
- A correct password on a bulk delete, demo removal, or Start over now clears failed attempts, as login does.
- The photo grid is now square, cropped tiles with a select circle and a ⋮ on each photo. Caption, date, show on frames, send to a frame, and delete moved into the ⋮ panel, which shrinks the page by more than half.
- The admin bar keeps Photos, Frames, Playlists, Tags, and Pair a frame; Stats, Login sessions, Technical details, GitHub, and Log out are under More.
- The Start slideshow preview fills its frame, and is hidden on phones so the controls come first. The Show dropdown is now Tag, defaulting to Any tag, and the remote reads naturally.
- Frame cards label the matte colours, and tag chips look like buttons. Login says what it's for, and playlist photos have a small Take out button.
- Captions on frames are about three times larger, sized to the screen, so they can be read across a room.
- The openmantel.com project site lists playlists, starting a slideshow on one frame, endless play, uploads from a phone, and photo details.
- Security fixes from red/blue team audit 1 (see README):
  - Request bodies are limited before any route reads them.
  - The client IP header is believed only from a local or private proxy.
  - Rate limits sweep themselves and treat each IPv6 /64 as one address.
  - Frames can hold at most two live connections, report only real photo ids, and can't fetch hidden photos.
  - Photos over 100 megapixels are refused before decoding, including HEIC files whose header doesn't match the image inside.
  - Failed uploads leave no temporary files.
  - Upload and bulk tag changes are limited.
  - Dot-segment paths are refused.
  - The database is private to the app user.
  - Frame setup scripts check their inputs.
  - Actions are pinned to commits.
  - `.env.local` can't be committed.
  - The Docker backup explains a missing `rclone`.
- Start slideshow says whose setup it replaces, keeps each frame's memories-first setting unless On this day is chosen, and stays disabled until the frame list has loaded. On a frame, On this day is described as all photos with today's first, which is what it shows. The frame list and remote refresh every 30 seconds.
- A frame catches up on changes it missed while its connection was down, as soon as it reconnects.
- Editing the playlist or settings a frame is showing no longer sends it back to the first photo, and a slideshow started while a photo was loading can't be overridden by that photo.
- Playlist edits run one at a time and a dropped photo is added in a single request, so quick drags can't race each other, and any failure reloads the playlist from the server. Dragging a photo that's already in the playlist lands where it's dropped.
- With a playlist chosen under Show, the photo grid hides Rearrange and Arrange by date, which change the library order, and links to the playlist's page.
- README covers playlists, starting on one frame, Deactivate, and uploading from an iPhone.
- `rebuild.sh` refuses to start while another rebuild is running in the same folder, and stops before restarting if a build is missing its server dependencies. Two overlapping runs had swapped in a broken build.
- README rewritten for accuracy and clarity.
- Slideshows never stop. After the last photo they start again, with a fresh shuffle each time round in random order, and a new round never opens on the photo that just ended the last one.
- A tagged admin slideshow now plays at random unless you choose Sequential. Before, it always played in your arranged order.
- Frame setup scripts use OpenMantel names for their launch agents, services, and shortcuts, and clean up installs made under the old names. A Mac frame keeps its pairing.
- `pnpm seed:ingest` reads `OPENMANTEL_PASSWORD` and `OPENMANTEL_SESSION`. The old `PICTURES_` names still work.
- The prebuilt image builds each architecture on its own native runner, with a 30-minute limit, and is also tagged with the commit. Emulated arm64 builds were hanging, so `latest` had stopped updating.
- Dependabot no longer proposes TypeScript or Node major versions; those move by hand.
- Tested 48-megapixel HEIC uploads: about 27 seconds on a 1 GB server, with no app restart.
- Prebuilt image builds now cancel when a newer commit arrives, so older code can't overwrite `latest`.
- Passwords need at least 12 characters.
- The Docker backup service takes its first snapshot at start.
- Frame setup no longer suggests automatic login, because FileVault prevents it.
- The project is now named OpenMantel, along with its repository and Docker image.
- Scripts and docs no longer assume one particular server or domain.
- Captions sit on a semi-transparent, edge-to-edge band, so they read on the lightest photos.
- The admin opens on the photo library, with frames on their own tab.
- Session ids are stored as hashes, so database backups can't be used to log in. Everyone logs in again once.
- Subresource integrity is off, because it blocked the page and adds nothing for self-hosted files.
- File types are read by `sharp` from the file's bytes, in place of the `file-type` package.
- Icons are bundled into the client, so the browser never calls the Iconify API.
- Frames and the admin grid load images from `/v/<id>-<variant>.webp`, so the service worker can cache them. `/api/img` is removed from the design and from device routes.
- Image URLs now require an admin session or a valid device, using nginx `auth_request`. This is planned for Phase 1.
- Pairing now mints the device token on the first poll after approval and delivers it with `Set-Cookie`.
- The CSP moved from nginx to the app, using per-request nonces.
- `rebuild.sh` builds into `.output.new` and swaps it in after a successful build.
- `rebuild.sh` creates database backups with owner-only permissions.
- Phase 0 pins pnpm 12.16.1 and declares its build script policy.
- The proxy config, not file permissions, keeps original photos private.
- `.gitignore` allows `.env.sample` and `.env.local`.

### Fixed

- Dragging photos works on touch screens, and phones also get Earlier and Later buttons.
- Builds on 1 GB servers no longer run out of Node heap.
- Esc now leaves the slideshow in full screen, where the browser would otherwise keep the key.
- Frame cards no longer overflow on phones, and a new frame's thumbnail appears right away.
- `/api/pair/approve` is no longer covered by the public route exemption.
- `rebuild.sh` no longer exits when its log or backup folder is empty.
